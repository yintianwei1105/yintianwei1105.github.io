I am a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne with 3 years' research experience in spatial data analysis, with a specific interest in the innovation of data-driven methods   to model, design and manage public transport.

I am skilled in machine learning, data visualization, and behavior modelling with Python and R. I have completed several [projects](https://yintianwei1105.github.io/Projects/)     with University of Queensland, CSIRO Data61, and state governments in Australia. 

I am currently working on a project in collaboration with the Victoria Department of Transport.

I also enjoy cooking, travelling and video editing.
