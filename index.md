As the patronage advisor at Yarra Trams, I am joining together quantitative and qualitative insights into the market for tram services in Melbourne and supporting the development of business cases for service change or capital investment projects.

As a PhD candidate, I have 3 years' experience in applied research, with a specific interest in the innovation of data-driven methods to solve problems in transportation. I have completed several industry-based projects and demonstrated the ability of transforming ideas and research into marketable products.

I am skilled in traffic flow estimation, public transport planning, and behaviour modelling. I have completed several [projects](https://yintianwei1105.github.io/Projects/)  with University of Queensland, CSIRO Data61, and state governments in Australia. 

I recently completed a project in collaboration with the Victoria Department of Transport and Yarra Tram.
