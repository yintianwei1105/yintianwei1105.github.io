## Modelling Objective and Subjective Public Transport Performance

Objective: Establish the relationship between customer satisfaction feedback and observed measures of attributes related to network performance.

 - Applied econometrics models on the survey data and discovered passengers have different expectations to different types of public transport attributes.
 - Matched survey data with smartcard transaction to evaluate how the actual network performance would influence people’s satisfaction and identified the key performance metrics.
 - Presented results in an international conference in Toronto, helping transit operators to make investment strategies that improve passengers’ satisfaction with public transport:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmQ6SHDylA
