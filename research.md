## Modelling Objective and Subjective Public Transport Performance

Objective: Establish the relationship between customer satisfaction feedback and observed measures of attributes related to network performance.

 - Developed a Latent Factor Model that categorized attributes based on their effects on passengers’ satisfaction.
 - Developed a Three Factor Structure Model to illustrate passengers have different expectations to different types of public transport attributes.
 - Matched survey data with smartcard transaction to evaluate how the actual network performance would influence people’s satisfaction and identified the key performance metrics.
 - Presented results at TRANSITDATA2020 in Toronto, helping transit operators to make investment strategies that improve passengers’ satisfaction with public transport.

## Exploring Infrequent Use of Public Transport in Brisbane

Objective: Explore the travel patterns of infrequent users of public transport

 - Processed the one-year smart card data in Brisbane.
 - Clustered public transport users based on regularity and visualized the travel time and locations of infrequent public transport users.
 - Presented results at TRANSITDATA2019 conference in Paris, helping in transit operators to develop demand responsive services for infrequent public transport users
